			<h1>Science of the Past</h1>
			<p>There have been many scientific advancements made to combat the spread and effects of disease, such as...</p>
			
			<h2>Vaccines</h2>
			<p>While inoculation has been practiced in some degree by Chinese monks as early as the year 1000 CE, it was only popularized in 1796 by
			Edward Jenner, who inoculated pations with cowpox to give immunity to the more severe smallpox. His methods would also be used to eradicate
			diseases such as rabies, diphtheria, anthrax, and cholera during the early 20th century. While vaccines normally work by introducing a weakened or dead 
			version of the germ to be protected against, the mRNA vaccine designed for Covid-19 instead uses a protein found on the virus' surface,
			ensuring immunity (or at least resistance), with little to no side effects.

			<h2>Masks</h2>
			<p>
				The use of the medical mask existed (if slightly apocryphally) as early as the Middle Ages, with doctors wearing
				beak-like masks to treat victims of the Bubonic Plague. However, the first use of facemasks to control the spread 
				of disease was during the early 1900s by Dr. Wu Lien Teh in Manchuria, to help quell the spread of a bubonic plague. 
				It would later see use in several hospitals all aorund the world, yet some doctors refused to use such devices, calling them
				"irritating." Today, the face mask is used to prevent the airborne spread of Covid-19, and can be seen all over the world saving countless lives.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Germ Theory</h2>
			<p>
				The development of germ theory, the idea that disease is spread by microscopic particles called microorganisms, is credited to three scientists: Robert Koch,
				Joseph Lister, and Louis Pasteur. By figuring out that disease was spread through microorganisms and not some other nebulous, untraceable force, scientists could
				better devise new ways to hinder the spread of disease, as well as cure those afflicted by it. Pasteur would later develop a system to sterilize milk by heating it,
				called Pasteurization, and Lister would be one of the first surgeons to sterilize the patients injuries, leading to greatly reduced post-surgical infection rates.
