		<h1> This Just In: Covid-19 </h1>
		<p> 
			Although the first instance of human coronavirus was discovered in 1965, the variant that now plagues the world today originated in Wuhan, China, 2019.
			Starting as a virus found in a bat, this disease has gone on to infect over 248 million people worldwide. Among those infected, about 2.8 million are
			from the Philippines. To prevent the spread of disease, the Philippines has declared several quarantines and began vaccinating its citizens in hopes to
			build herd immunity while minimizing casualties and infection. However, only about 31.88% of the population, 35.4 million people, are fully vaccinated.
			Covid-19 symptoms are usually shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue, among other things. It normally affects the very old, although the latest variant, the Delta Variant, puts younger people at risk due to its
			increased contagiousness. While it's not gonna be a while before herd immunity is established, we can still take appropriate measures to protect ourselves and our families from infection
			by:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Wearing a Mask </li>
			<li> Not going outdoors unless necessary </li>
			<li> Sanitizing your hands after interactions </li>
			<li> and getting vaccinated if you haven't already. </li>
		</ul>
